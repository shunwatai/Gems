### How to play:

    1. choose the time limit that you prefer.
    2. choose the grid size that you want to, 6x6 or 8x8. 6x6 is the default.
    3. the game will stat immediately after chose the grid size.
    4. use your mouse to drag a gems to the cell around it and then drop it.
    5. there is no moving rules. please just move the gems to it closest cell(up/down/left/right) like other similar games.
    6. this program has bugs, if you see a cell contained two gems, please restart the game.

### Rules:
    Swipe to match three or more gems of the same color in a line, T, or L formation.

    Gems will disappear when you match gems, making room for more gems to fall from the top.

    When gems fall from the top of the board, it may lead to more matches.
    Each gem equals to one score.
